# discord-bot
This is a discord bot that I wrote in the summer of 2020, it was written with a few friends at the time.
It was written in JavaScript, using Node.js, Discord.js, simple-ssh, and more.
It has Moderation Features, Server/User Info Commands, and more.

The Music Package is from Josia50 and is used with permission.

The bot no longer works due to not being maintained along with using old versions of discord.js, and not using slash commands.

_This project was copied from a private repository, and will not be maintained or updated. The token within the config files has been canceled._
